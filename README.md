# Simple Chess AI
This is a simple Chess AI, that uses the minimax algorithm(alpha-beta pruning) to evaluate the next few positions. It doesn't learn from played matches or any dataset. If you scroll down you can see the next moves for the AI to choose from. The algorithm isn't perfect but it know's how to capture figures and more. If you have enough computing power make the tree deeper, so the AI becomes smarter. Now have fun play against it!
